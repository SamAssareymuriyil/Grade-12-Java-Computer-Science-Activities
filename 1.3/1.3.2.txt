The concept of the actual assignement wasn't hard to do, however as I hadn't done Java before this class putting it into the right syntax and semantics required some research. I learned about JTextArea and how it could be used. Additonally as I didn't like the basic white color and font preloaded in the GUI, I did some additional research to find out how to change the font and background color. Overall it wasn't a very difficult assignment, and one that I got done very quickly once I understood the basic formatting of the language. I would like to say that I am adept in using javascript and not terrible at python, but learning Java compared to them hasn't been terrible so far and I feel that Java using JavaSwing makes it super easy and intuitive to integrate a GUI. The only problem I encountered was because of a careless mistake of mine, when trying to run the code from the terminal, I mispelled the file name in the 'java GreetSam' line and this caused me to retry compiling and changing storage locations. I solved the issue by just actually looking at the command I typed as I was just pressing the up arrow to repeat the command. I did not have the assistance of anyone else for the assignemnt, and when it finally worked after I fixed my careless error I felt very accomplished but also dissappointed considering that it took me about the same amount of time to do the assignment and to notice a spelling mistake.
